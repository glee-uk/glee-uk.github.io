<h2>History of this site</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://fsc.org.uk/">FSC</a> people Leo Murray and Jack Freedman first put together a collection of
  MP3s at <a href="www.virtualcampfire.co.uk">virtualcampfire.co.uk</a>, around 1999, using recordings
  from the throughout the 1990s.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://oolong.co.uk">Fergus Murray</a> took over the development of it in September 2009.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://tim.pizey.uk/">Tim</a> copied the content to github, registered glee.org.uk, and
  updated this site in July 2014, with another push in November 2017.
</p>
<p>
A push by Oxford Glee in 2024 led us first to aim for a recording of every song in the 2017 Songbook, then
  to aim for a recording of every song<br> in all the <a href="../songbooks/">FSC songbooks</a>.
</p>
<p>
  In the summer of 2024 Emily Kerr tracked down copies of all the <a href="songbooks/">Songbooks</a> and created PDFS.
</p>
<p>
  Added a lyrics page for every title.
</p>
<p>
  Changed the selection mechanism to enable a playlist to be selected.
</p>
<p>Added mix tapes.</p>
